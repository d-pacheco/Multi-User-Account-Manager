# Multi-User Account Manager

Multi-User Account Manager is a GUI application that uses the tkinter framework to allow users to register their own account to create, edit, delete, and store login information for other applications.

## Motivation

I wanted to create my own password manager that could be used by multiple users in my home on the family computer without compromising each family members personal passwords.

## Things I struggled with

- Creating and designing classes and their methods in a manner to coherently work together in large scale projects
	- Using a controller class to help manage and integrate the sub-classes for the overall application

## Things I learned from this project

- Better class design and learning how to integrate classes to work with one another
- Building functions and methods for reusability rather than for an intended single purpose
- Diligent software planning, decorator design pattern and builder pattern to be better implemented in future projects
